# MOBILE APP FOR BETTER DIABETES MANAGEMENT

An iOS mobile app that communicates with a prototype of a smart insulin syringe to record insulin delivery and provide better diabetes management to patients.

## ABSTRACT
Documenting insulin injections in a timely manner is onerous for patients, can be error-ridden, and lead to misinterpretation of the doses. If these errors lead to insulin overdose, a condition called acute hypoglycemia may result. Hypoglycemia is a sign of a health problem commonly found in diabetic patients which refers to an abnormally low blood sugar level in the body. Severe cases of hypoglycemia may cause unconsciousness, seizure or may even lead to death. A smart syringe that accurately records insulin doses and an app that notifies patients to take bolus and basal doses in a timely manner could avoid hypo/hyperglycemia. The data captured by the smart insulin syringe is sent to a mobile device using Bluetooth technology. The recorded data can be viewed by the patient in Apple's Health app, the patient can also share the health records during health checkups.
