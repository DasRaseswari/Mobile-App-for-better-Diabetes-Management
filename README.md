# MOBILE APP FOR BETTER DIABETES MANAGEMENT

An iOS mobile app that communicates with a prototype of a smart insulin syringe to record insulin delivery and provide better diabetes management to patients.

## ABSTRACT
This paper presents a feasibility study, product definition and the prototype of a smart insulin syringe. This study shall help BD’s internal R&D team to design and develop a smart disposable syringe capable of delivering insulin as well as recording the amount of insulin delivered. Documenting insulin injections in a timely manner is onerous for patients, can be error-ridden, and lead to misinterpretation of the doses. If these errors lead to insulin overdose, a condition called acute hypoglycemia may result. Hypoglycemia is a sign of a health problem commonly found in diabetic patients which refers to an abnormally low blood sugar level in the body. Severe cases of hypoglycemia may cause unconsciousness, seizure or may even lead to death. A smart syringe that accurately records insulin doses and an app that notifies patients to take bolus and basal doses in a timely manner could avoid hypo/hyperglycemia.

With its successful implementation, the product will allow diabetic patients to accurately capture the insulin doses and take multiple daily injections more confidently. This project can be categorized into two sections. First accomplished task was to develop a technology that allows an insulin syringe to capture the insulin doses. The second was to create a mobile app to store and view the captured data. The data captured by the smart insulin syringe is sent to a mobile device using Bluetooth technology. In production, the mobile app could be designed to analyze the recorded insulin data and alert the patient if it is above the normal range and send reminders to the patient to take insulin at the right time. 

This study will create an impact on the sponsor organization and will facilitate the company’s competitiveness in the injection market. This challenge project provided a great opportunity and platform for the candidate to hone multiple technical and leadership skills. It prepared the candidate to assess risks, be responsible, resourceful, develop and improve communication as well as interpersonal skills. It enabled the candidate to connect across various disciplines namely stakeholders, team members, patients and medical advisors.
